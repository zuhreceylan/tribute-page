      Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress and self-taught inventor.
      While she was a famous Hollywood star during the Golden Age of cinema,
      she also co-invented a frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology.
      This invention later became the foundation for modern wireless
      communication such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS.
